<h1>First adventure with Lavarvel</h1>
<p>This is my first project in Laravel framework.</p>
<p>I want to write down my progress and the topics I learned here.</p>
<p>You can download the current state of my learning <a href="https://github.com/Konradx3/LaravelNauka">here</a>.</p>
<p>After downloading the project, make sure you have <a href="https://getcomposer.org">Composer</a> and <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>.</p>
<p>Then use the commands:</p>
<p>- composer install</p>
<p>- npm install</p>
   <p> -npm run dev</p>
      <p>  if it doesn't work use - npm run build </p>
